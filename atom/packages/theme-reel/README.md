# Theme Reel package

An Atom package that allows you to quickly switch between syntax themes. Inspired by the excellent Themr package for Sublime Text.

Press `ctrl-shift-[` for the previous theme, and `ctrl-shift-]` for the next theme. The new theme name is briefly shown in the bottom left of the status bar.
